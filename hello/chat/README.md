# Interactive Chat project in RUST

The idea behaind of this project is confused.
Yes, i will do something in rust, thats all.

This is a simple terminal-based chat application I created to learn how to work rust.
It focuses on exploring key features like channels for message passing.
The program allows users to send and receive messages asynchronously, providing an opportunity to experiment with concurrency and communication in Rust

```bash
`cargo run --release --bin server localhost:8080`

# You can run X times this command in multiple terminal window and see whats appened
`cargo run --release --bin client localhost:8080`

# For each terminal window use this interactive command
join {CHAT_NAME}

post {CHAT_NAME} something
```
